# Room Booking App Frontend

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-09d9fe?style=for-the-badge)](https://react.dev/)

The client frontend of the app.

<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<br>

## Requirements
Install all the necessary node modules by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

<br>

## How to Run

### Step 1:
Run the following command, replacing `[env]` with either `prod`, `dev` or `toy`, where each option
corresponds to a build environment

```bash
npm run start:[env]
```

<br>

### Step 2:

Below are the different URLs hosted for each environment. Visit the link to the corresponding environment you have ran.

| Environment | Port |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Production | http://localhost:9112 |
| Development | http://localhost:9111 |
| Toy | http://localhost:9113 |


>[!TIP]
> Remember to also run the backend server of the app. Instructions on how to run the backend are over [here](../backend/README.md)

## Available Scripts

>[!NOTE]
>Most of the below is autogenerated by React when you run `create-react-app`

<br>


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### `npm run start:prod`

Runs the app in production mode.

### `npm run start:dev`

Runs the app in development mode.

### `npm run start:toy`

Run the app in toy mode.

### `npm run start`

Also runs the app in toy mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build:prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder for the production environment.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run build:dev`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder for the development environment.

### `npm run build:toy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder for the toy environment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
